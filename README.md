# Night Minesweeper

You're a minesweeper. No light, no map. Absolute darkness. Your dance with death begins.

## Rules

* Walk across the field.
* If you see the message about mines, you can put the flag on the adjacent cell.
* If you make a step on the cell with mine without putting a mine flag, you die :(
* If you find out all mines, you win!
